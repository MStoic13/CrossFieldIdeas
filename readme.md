# Cross-Field Ideas

It's been a life dream of mine to connect ideas from all across human knowledge in meaningful ways depending on the context and I would have liked to train a program / bot / AI / something to do it for me in order to get through more knowledege than I could in one lifetime. 

I wrote a small rambling about this here https://stirringsteer.blogspot.com/2014/11/skeletons-of-ideas-or-cross-field-is.html

## Definitions

Building Block = a unit of knowledge which cannot be broken into other units. Like an axiom. "paper" is a building block in origami, "only one line can pass through two dots" is a building block of Euclidean geometry. "bit" is a building block in computer science.

Concept = A unit of knowledege, which can be broken down into other concepts all the way down to building blocks. "crane" is a concept in origami. "rectangle" is a concept in Euclidean geometry. "merge sort" is a concept in computer science.

## Notes

Wikipedia seems to be the best source of concepts and building blocks for all human knowledge.
