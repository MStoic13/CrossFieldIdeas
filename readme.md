# Cross-Field Ideas

It's been a lifelong dream of mine to connect ideas from all across human knowledge in meaningful ways depending on the context and I would have liked to train a program / bot / AI / something to do it for me in order to get through more knowledege than I could in one lifetime. 

I wrote a small rambling about this here https://stirringsteer.blogspot.com/2014/11/skeletons-of-ideas-or-cross-field-is.html

## Notes

Wikipedia seems to be the best source of concepts and building blocks for all human knowledge. That and books. Definitely books from the public domain. Textbooks, too and other paid books as long as someone purchases them for the Cross-Field Ideas AI.

## Inspirations

- my own intuition, introspections and self reflections
- Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Analogies, particularly Sequence and Copycat
- Melanie Mitchell's work on AI analogies
