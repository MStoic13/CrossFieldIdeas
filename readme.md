# Cross-Field Ideas

It's been a lifelong dream of mine to connect ideas from all across human knowledge in meaningful ways depending on the context and I would have liked to train a program / bot / AI / something to do it for me in order to get through more knowledege than I could in one lifetime. 

I wrote a small rambling about this here https://stirringsteer.blogspot.com/2014/11/skeletons-of-ideas-or-cross-field-is.html

## Inspirations

- my own intuition, introspections and self reflections
- Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Analogies, particularly Sequence and Copycat
- Melanie Mitchell's work on AI analogies 

## Notes

### Source of knowledge

- Wikipedia seems to be the best source of concepts and building blocks for all human knowledge. 
- That and books. Definitely books from the public domain. Textbooks, too and other paid books as long as someone purchases them for the Cross-Field Ideas AI.

### Steps 

1. source of knowledge: wikipedia, public domain digital books. Format: English language text
2. parse source text from the English language into concepts, building approrpiate links between concepts based on the source text and in the appropriate contexts. This basically builds the AI's knowledge.
3. querying the knowledge. There are multiple applications to this.

### Applications of such a knowledge base 

- helping people learn by asking questions and exploring, going on serendipituous journeys
- finding outside of the box solutions to problems 
- innovating by finding isomorphisms between fields of konwledge that to humans seem disconnected. innovating intentionally instead of waiting for accidents to happen and for the right people to meet and have the right conversation
- expanding human knowledge based on existing knowledge (this won't work with concepts that don't exist yet since the AI doesn't have access to reality to run its own experiments)
- finding gaps in knowledge and patterns 

### Corner Cases and Examples

Purpose and actions can be deduced from an objects attributes. Example: earth shovel and snow shovel.
